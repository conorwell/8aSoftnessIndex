Rock climbing is a sport with no referees, and the difficulty of each route is considered subjective. 
This REST API, built with Flask, maintains a database of climbers and their likelihood to suggest a higher or lower grade than the average for each outdoor climb using data from 8a.nu. 
The API supports posting new users to the database by request, returning scores already calculated, updating previously calculated scores, and returning a leaderboard sorted from high scores to low.
